# sovereign: how it works

Mapped at 2026-09-25 from commit 87de092.

## What this is

8 parts, mostly JavaScript (52 files) and TypeScript (2). Work enters through 5 doors; CI and Release each reach 2 parts, and CI is followed because a pull request goes through it. It publishes to npm. People run sovereign. People import @mcptoolshop/sovereign.

## What changed since the last map

This is the first map.

## What comes in

1. **CI.** On a pull request to main touching 7 paths; on a push to main touching 7 paths; or by hand. Runs bin/sovereign.js, test/determinism.test.mjs, test/playability.test.mjs and 1 more.
2. **Release.** When a tag matching `v*` is pushed. Runs bin/sovereign.js, test/determinism.test.mjs, test/playability.test.mjs and 1 more.
3. **Deploy GitHub Pages.** On a push to main; or by hand. Runs site/astro.config.mjs and site/src/.
4. **@mcptoolshop/sovereign** (the package people import). Loads bin/sovereign.js.
5. **sovereign** (a command people run). Runs bin/sovereign.js.

## What happens through CI

1. The workflow runs bin/sovereign.js in bin and test/determinism.test.mjs, test/playability.test.mjs and test/smoke.test.mjs in test.

## Who reads the results

CI writes nothing this map can see.

## The other doors

**Release** runs bin/sovereign.js, test/determinism.test.mjs, test/playability.test.mjs and 1 more, publishes to npm, and creates a GitHub release.

**Deploy GitHub Pages** runs site/astro.config.mjs and site/src/, writes to site/dist, which is not tracked, and deploys the site.

**@mcptoolshop/sovereign** (the package people import) loads bin/sovereign.js.

**sovereign** (a command people run) runs bin/sovereign.js.

## What breaks what

- **bin** is imported by no other part and sits on the path of 4 doors.
- **test** is imported by no other part and sits on the path of 2 doors.

## What tends to change together

No two source files changed together often enough to name.

Window: 180 days; a pair counts from 3 shared commits, since 0 source files reach 10 revisions; the floor rises to 10 when 25 do.

## What no test touches

- **tools** is imported by no test.

bin is touched by tests only through a spawn: a test runs its files as a child process.

## Written but never read

No place this map can see is written, so none goes unread.

## Helpers that look duplicated

No two parts export a helper that looks alike.

## Generated, never hand-edited

Nothing in this repository writes to a tracked place this map can see.

## Hand-authored

People write .github/, experiments/, release/, the repository root and site/; 10 writes with paths built at run time may land here.

## Where to start

Start at bin/sovereign.js to follow one run of sovereign end to end. This path follows sovereign (a command people run) from its entry, since CI runs only tests and scripts that import no code here.

## What this map cannot see

- 1 import could not be resolved: `test/determinism.test.mjs` imports a path built at run time.
- 10 writes and 9 reads use paths built at run time and are not named here.
- 1 write goes to places this repository does not track, so it is not listed as generated.
- 1 read goes to a path its caller passes, not to this repository.
- 1 command is built at run time and not followed.
- Statistics confidence is low: fewer than 20 source files reach 10 revisions in the window.
